### Getting Start
Here are some tips that would help you get ready to work.

- Please go to  [about (to) go](https://go/:about/#edit)  page to set up the short cut `go/***` for Novartis pages  
- Please go to  [up4growth](https://novartis.csod.com/ui/lms-learner-home/home?utm_source=Welcome_Page&utm_medium=tile&utm_campaign=Learner_Home)  (or with short-cut `go/up4growth`) to check whether you have any assignment. Please finish it before the due date, or the system will send notification to our manager (which should definitely be avoided)  
- Please send a greeting email to  [Raymond](raymond.przybysz@novartis.com)  and copy to  [Anne](yen-hua.chen@novartis.com)  and  [Lujia](lujia.zhou@novartis.com)  
- Please import **Novartis Holiday** to your Outlook with following steps:

  File > Options > Calendar > Calendar Options > Add Holidays > USUS (current year)
  {: .fs-3 .ls-5 .code-example }
  
- Please set up your signature with the format:
