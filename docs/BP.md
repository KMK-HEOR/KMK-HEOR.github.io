### Mindset

#### What is our responsibility?
{: .text-purple-000}
#### We are here to help clients' success!
{: .no_toc .text-red-100}
- Figure out what are clients' needs and objectives
- Align with your clients. You are not in the opposite positions
- Provide your expertise to help clients clarify business needs
  - We have obligation to explain risk and limitation
  - Client is the one to make final decision
  - It is okay to have disagreement with the decisions, BUT need commitment
  - Document each step of decision making and the risk/limitation via email, then archive email

#### How to achieve this goal?
{: .text-purple-000}
#### Aim to solve the problem!
{: .no_toc .text-red-100}
- If there is a conflict, propose solutions/options along with providing sufficient evidences for challenges/difficulties
  - Express your understanding and intention to solve the problem
  - Ask clients' needs at minimum level and provide options
  - Do NOT explain why we cannot do it all along
  - Discuss the way to avoid those situations in future
- Be prepared to work overtime for urgent and high priority projects if it is inevitable

### Work flow with client

|**1. Project Triage**|
|- Receive new project from team lead<br/>- Request a discussion with analytical lead (avoid communication, please via emails)<br/>- Before the meeting, review related materials, prepare questions, determine the difficulty, and estimate the timeline|
|**2. Kickoff Meeting**|
|- Clarify project scope and timeline<br/>- Propose a reasonable timeline, or ask analytical lead for a hard timeline|
|- Resonable timeline:<br/>a) Send out meeting minutes, including project scope, necessary documents, with timeline via email<br/>- Unreasonable timeline<br/>a) Provide evidence and propose solution<br/>b) Reach and negotiate for a timeline agree by both<br/>c) Send out meeting minutes, including proejct scope, necessary documents, with new timeline via email|
|**3. Change Scope**|
|- Confirm the change<br> - Clarify the new scope<br/> - Re-evaluate the timeline|
|**4. Deliver Result**|
|- Check the spelling, grammar, and unify the format<br/> - Summarize key findings in the email<br/>- Check with analytical lead whether to have a review together|
|**5. Postscript**|
|- If any follow-up project, go through the process again<br/> - Archive all the necessary emails, such as confirming project scope, timeline, result delivery, etc|

### Timeline
#### Factors need to be considered when estimating timeline
{: .text-purple-000}
- Timeline estimation consideration
  - Consistency across the whole team (e.g. 2 weeks for cohort building), please consult your team lead
  - Necessary information (i.e. project scope, study codes, etc) collection
  - Complexity of the project
  - Stability and the performance of the server
  - QC level
  - Other workload
- Additional timeline estimation consideration for proejct lead
  - Junior may need more time
  - Please help junior analyst to address the problem when the proejct takes longer than usual time
    - Programming structure: help them to re-structure (e.g. lower the time/space complexity) and improve the efficiency
    - Programming logic: identify the problem of their logic
    - Unfamiliar syntax, function, or model: please provide keywords or supporting documents, websites
- **Timeline estimation should be consistent across the team, no matter the experience levels**

#### Whether and how to negotiate the timeline
{: .text-purple-000}
- **Not every deadline should be negotiated**, don't negotiate resonable timeline. If you can't decide, please consult your team lead
- Before sending out the negotiation request, please
  - Clarify the importance and priority of the project with analytical lead
  - Understand analytical lead's needs, e.g. whether it's a hard timeline
- While negotiating the timeline for a regular project, please provide:
  - New timeline, or separate original reqest into several milestone (which we could provide partial result to the analytical lead)
  - **Sufficient evidences** to convince clients why this timeline is hard to meet:
    - Current **workload** (please let your team lead know if you are fully occupied by other projects before discussing with the analytical lead)
    - **Complexity** of the project
    - Unstable server
- If its an **urgent project** which requires work overtime
  - Express the **understanding of the urgency**
  - Clarify this is **not common practice**
  - Estimate how many **extra** hours you need
  - Notify your team lead

#### When timeline has been determined
{: .text-purple-000}
- Stick on timeline
  - **Delay** project without agreement with clients is **not acceptable**
  - Please try to deliver the result during the working hour
- Adjust timeline according to the change of scope
  - Not every change needs to adjust timeline
  - Need client's agreement on the new timeline
  - Must document the change of scope and timeline via email, remember to archive the email

### Responsibilities for programmers
#### Leadership of primary programmer
{: .text-purple-000}
- Attend all related meeting and lead the discussion with clients
- Work directly with the client
- Send out emails to summarize meeting mintes and any change of the project discussed previously.
  - Should clearly record the timeline
  - Mark the change with *bright color* in the emails
  - Use *track chagnes* in word files
- QC the result (self or secondary): 
  - Arrange QC steps and QC timeline
  - Fully explain the logic to the QC programmers and take their comments into consideration
 - Summarize findings when delivering result. Double check the spelling, grammar, and unify the format

#### Responsibilities of QC programmer
{: .text-purple-000}
- Attend related meetings
- Strictly follow the QC timeline
- Disucss with primary programmer about any findings or discrepancies
- Request primary programmer to initiate discussion with client if there is any conflict opnions between 2 programmers
