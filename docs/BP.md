### Mindset

#### What is our responsibility?
{: .no_toc}
#### We are here to help clients' success!
{: .no_toc .text-red-100}
- Figure out what are clients' needs and objectives
- Align with your clients. You are not in the opposite positions
- Provide your expertise to help clients clarify business needs
  - We have obligation to explain risk and limitation
  - Client is the one to make final decision
  - It is okay to have disagreement with the decisions, BUT need commitment
  - Document each step of decision making and the risk/limitation via email, then archive email

#### How to achieve this goal?
{: .no_toc}
#### Aim to solve the problem!
{: .no_toc .text-red-100}
- If there is a conflict, propose solutions/options along with providing sufficient evidences for challenges/difficulties
  - Express your understanding and intention to solve the problem
  - Ask clients' needs at minimum level and provide options
  - Do NOT explain why we cannot do it all along
  - Discuss the way to avoid those situations in future
- Be prepared to work overtime for urgent and high priority projects if it is inevitable

#### Work flow with client
